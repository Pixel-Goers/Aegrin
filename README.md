## Scene Files

### ðŸ§© What Are Scene Files in Unity?

A scene file in Unity is like a level or screen in your game.
It contains everything that's placed in that part of the gameâ€”like characters, objects, lights, cameras, and backgrounds.

---

### ðŸŽ® Think of it like this:

Imagine you're making a stage play. Each scene in your game is like a different act:

* One scene might be the **main menu**
* Another could be a **village**
* Another might be a **battlefield**
* Or a **cutscene**

In Unity, each of these would be saved as a separate `.unity` file (scene file).

---

### ðŸ”§ What's Inside a Scene?

A scene file contains:

* GameObjects (like players, enemies, platforms)
* Lighting and camera setups
* UI elements (like health bars or buttons)
* Sound triggers
* Scripting references

But not the actual code, art, or audio files â€” it just tells Unity how to arrange and use them in that scene.

---

### ðŸ“‚ Where Are They?

Scene files are saved in your project under:

```
Assets/Scenes/
```

and they end with `.unity`
Example: `MainMenu.unity`, `Level1.unity`, `BossFight.unity`

---

### ðŸ§  TL;DR

A scene file is a saved part of your game world â€” like a level or menu screen.
It tells Unity what appears there and how it all works together.
